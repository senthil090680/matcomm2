				<img src="<?=$confValues['IMGSURL']?>/infopg_reddy1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" />We are a socio-economically dominant caste in South India. Though we regard Andhra Pradesh as our homeland and Telugu as our mother tongue, we form an 
				important part of the society in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharastra as well and we are proficient in the languages spoken in the three states.<br><br>
				There are several theories on our origins. According to the early historians, the first Reddy was a charioteer who impressed a Rashtrakuta king (Rashtrakutas ruled large parts of southern, central and northern India between the sixth and the 13th centuries) with his courage in the battle.<br><br>
				Reddy is claimed to be a corruption of 'Ratti' meaning chariot or charioteer and our ancestors were charioteers for the Rashtrakutas. Some historians claim that "Reddy" is derived from the Telugu word "redu" which means farmland. During the British period, Reddys in general and especially the ones in Nellore and Chittoor districts took to modern forms of agriculture, helping them to increase their wealth. We were also one of the first communities to place importance on education thanks to our proximity to Chennai.<br><br>
				Many of us migrated to Tamil Nadu centuries ago and have formed a distinct community that is completely incorporated into Tamil culture and do not necessarily feel a closer affinity to our Andhra cousins. However, marriage between Andhra and Tamil Reddys is still common. Reddiar is a Tamilianised version of Reddy.<br><br>
				Though traditionally a farming community, many of us have entered business, real estate, construction and films. There are 52 sub-divisions among our community.

			In Telangana there is a Podamuri or Vastradanam ceremony. In this ceremony, the initial examination of horoscopes takes place at the house of the bride in the presence of the bride's and bridegroom's families.<br><br>
			The astrologer writes his calculations and opinion on a piece of palmyra leaf and hands it over to the bride groom's relations. If the horoscopes match, a day is fixed for the ceremony. This date is also written down and handed to the bride's family and to the bridegroom's relations. The astrologer and the bridegroom's party are then invited to a feast in the bride's house. The astrologer also receives gifts in the form of money or cloth.
