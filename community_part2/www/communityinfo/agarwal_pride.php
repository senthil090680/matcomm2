            <b>The steel man of the world</b><br /><br />
            <img src="http://img.agarwalmatrimony.com/images/Agarwal_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>The London-based, Rajasthan born steel baron is the chief of ArcelorMittal and one of the richest men in the world.<br />
            The Financial Times named Mittal Person of the Year in 2006. In May 2007, he was named one of the "100 Most Influential People" by Time magazine. In 2010, Forbes magazine listed Mittal the world's fifth richest person with a personal wealth of US$28.7 billion. He was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 2007.<br /><br />
            Lakshmi Narayan Mittal also known as Lakshmi Niwas Mittal was born in a Rajasthan village in 1950. He graduated with a degree in commerce from St. Xavier's College in Calcutta. He later married Usha Mittal, and had a son and daughter.<br /><br />
            Mittal belongs to the Marwari Aggarwal caste and his grandfather worked for the Tarachand Ghanshyam Das firm, one of the leading Marwari industrial firms of pre-independence India. <br /><br />
            Mittal began his career working in the family's steelmaking business in India, and has over 30 years of experience working in steel and related industries. Mittal founded the company Mittal Steel (formerly the LNM Group) in 1976 and was responsible for the development of its businesses. <br /><br />
            Mittal pioneered the development of integrated mini-mills and the use of Direct Reduced Iron or "DRI" as a scrap substitute for steelmaking and led the consolidation process of the global steel industry.<br /><br />
            In 2008, he merged Mittal Steel with Arcelor to create the largest steel company in the world with over 281,000 employees in more than 60 countries. It ranks 28th on the 2009 Fortune Global 500 list. The company is headquartered in Luxembourg City, the former seat of Arcelor.<br />
            Mittal was awarded Fortune magazines "European Businessman of the Year 2004" and also "Steelmaker of the Year" in 1996 by New Steel, and the "Willy Korf Steel Vision Award" in 1998, for outstanding vision, entrepreneurship, leadership and success in global steel development from American Metal Market and PaineWeber's World Steel Dynamics. <br />
            Lakshmi Mittal has become something of a cult figure in the global steel industry. He is an active philanthropist and a member of several trusts. Mittal is a member of the Foreign Investment Council in Kazakhstan, the International Investment Council in South Africa, the World Economic Forum's International Business Council and the International Iron and Steel Institute's Executive Committee. He is a Director of ICICI Bank Limited and is on the Advisory Board of the Kellogg School of Management in the U.S. <br />
            Mittal is the wealthiest person in Britain. His house in Kensington, bought in 2003 for $128 million, is the most expensive house ever purchased. The Kensington house is decorated with marble taken from the same quarry that supplied the Taj Mahal. The extravagant show of wealth has been referred to as the "Taj Mittal". It has 12 bedrooms, an indoor pool, Turkish baths and parking for 20 cars. It is said that he spend $55 million on his daughter's wedding celebrations in Versailles in 2004.
