            <img src="http://img.goundarmatrimony.com/images/Goundar_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>Muttiah Muralitharan, better known as Murali, was rated the greatest Test match bowler ever by Wisden Cricketers' Almanac in 2002. He retired from Test cricket in 2010, bagging his 800th and final wicket on 22 July 2010 from the final ball in his last test match. <br /><br />
            Muralitharan is the highest wicket-taker in both Test cricket as well as One Day Internationals (ODIs). He took the wicket of Gautam Gambhir on 5 February 2009 in Colombo to overtake Wasim Akram's ODI record of 502 wickets. <br /><br />
            Muralitharan became the highest wicket-taker in Test cricket when he overtook the previous record-holder Shane Warne on 3 December 2007. Muralitharan had previously held the record when he surpassed Courtney Walsh's 519 wickets in 2004. But he suffered a shoulder injury later that year and was overtaken by Warne.<br /><br />
            Averaging over six wickets per Test, Muralitharan is one of the most successful bowlers in the game. Muralitharan held the number one spot in the International Cricket Council's player rankings for Test bowlers for a record 1,711 days spanning 214 Test matches.<br /><br />
            He plays domestic cricket for the Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club, and plays in the Indian Premier League for Chennai Super Kings.<br /><br />
            Interestingly, Muralitharan's bowling action has often been called into question on a number of occasions by umpires and sections of the cricket community. He was cleared by the ICC after a biomechanical analysis under simulated playing conditions first in 1996 and again in 1999. <br /><br />
            The legality of his doosra was first called into question in 2004 as it was found to exceed the ICC elbow extension limit by nine degrees, five degrees being the limit for spinners at that time. Based on official studies into bowling actions, which revealed that 99% of all bowlers exceed the elbow flexion limits, ICC revised the limits applying to all bowlers in 2005. Muralitharan's doosra falls within the revised limits.<br /><br />
            He is the first and only Tamil of Indian origin to represent Sri Lanka in international cricket. He holds Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI) and does not need a visa for traveling to India. <br /><br />
            Muralitharan's paternal grandfather Periyasamy Sinasamy came from South India to work in the tea plantations of central Sri Lanka in 1920. Muralitharans belong to the Kongu Vellalar Goundar caste. Sinasamy later returned to the country of his birth with his daughters and settled in Tiruchirapalli, Tamil Nadu, India. However his sons, including Muralitharan's father Muttiah, remained in Sri Lanka.<br /><br />
            Muralitharan was born in the village of Nattarampotha in Kundasale (near Kandy), the eldest of the four sons to Sinnasamy Muttiah and Lakshmi. Muttiah, runs a successful biscuit-making business.<br /><br />
            When he was nine years old Muralitharan was sent to St. Anthony's College, Kandy, a private school run by Benedictine monks. He began his cricketing career as a medium pace bowler but on the advice of his school coach, Sunil Fernando, he took up off-spin. <br /><br />
            After leaving school he joined Tamil Union Cricket and Athletic Club and was selected for the Sri Lanka A tour of England in 1991. He played in five games but failed to capture a single wicket. On his return to Sri Lanka he impressed against Allan Border's Australian team in a practice game and went on to make his Test debut at R. Premadasa Stadium in the Second Test Match of the series.<br /><br />
            Muralitharan married Madhimalar Ramamurthy, an Indian, on 21 March 2005. Madhimalar is the daughter of late Dr S. Ramamurthy of Malar Hospitals and his wife Dr Nithya Ramamurthy. Their first child, Naren, was born in January 2006.<br /><br />
