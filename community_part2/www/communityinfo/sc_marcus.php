			Schedule Castes<br><br>
			There are many schedule castes in India. Though they hail from different regions, the marriage customs and rituals followed in a schedule caste wedding are more or less the same. Members of this caste are spread throughout the country but most people like to marry within the caste. Though pretty much similar what distinguishes one SC wedding from another is the regional influence of the place/places the bride and bride-groom hail from.<br><br>
			Pre-Wedding Rituals:<br><br>
			Bariksha- This can be likened to the betrothal ceremony.  In this, the girl's family sends a silver bowl full of rice, supari and turmeric powder and an envelop containing cash, as a recognition of their acceptance of the marriage proposal.<br><br>
			Sagai- During the sagai or engagement ceremony, the groom's family visits the house of the bride with gifts, jewelry and dresses for the bride. The would-be mother-in-law of the bride also applies red tikka on her forehead and places all the gift items on her lap. <br><br>
			Haldi ceremony: This ceremony takes places in both the houses of the bride as well as the groom separately. The significance of applying a paste of turmeric, oil and other things is to purify the couples mind, body and soul for a healthy and happy beginning of their married life. <br><br>
			Tilak Ceremony: This ceremony is held in the groom's house. All members of the bride's family and close relatives visit the groom's family with gifts, jewelery and cash, which is offered to the groom and a red tilak is put on his forehead.<br><br>
			Bhaat- Bhaat is a lunch ceremony organized by the maternal uncle of the bride for the groom and his family members. Gifts are also given by the bride's uncle to the groom and his family. <br><br>
			Wedding Rituals<br><br>
			Baraat: This is the wedding procession that takes the groom to the bride's house. At the entrance of the venue, the groom's family is warmly received by the bride's family, after which the bride comes into the wedding hall and the Jaimala or exchange of garlands takes place. After this, the couple is taken to the mandap, where the actual wedding ceremony takes place, with the priest reciting the spiritual prayers. <br><br>
			Kanyadan: This is the ceremony during which the bride is handed over to the groom as his life partner by the bride's father.<br><br>
