				<img src="<?=$confValues['IMGSURL']?>/infopg_iyer.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" />The name of our community is derived from the title Ayya which is often used by people in Tamil Nadu to designate respectable people. The title is thought to be derived from a Proto-Dravidian term denoting an elder brother. It is used in that meaning in Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam. It also means 'noble'.<br><br>
				Most of  our community members are followers of the Advaita philosophy propounded by Adi Shankara. We also use other surnames such as Sastri or Bhattar. A breakaway sect of Sri Vaishnavas later formed a community called "Iyengars".<br><br>
				We are South Indian Brahmins who reside in the states of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. We are predominantly Smarthas or followers of the Smriti texts.<br><br>
				We are concentrated mainly along the Cauvery delta districts of Nagapattinam, Thanjavur, Tiruvarur and Tiruchirapalli where we form almost 10 per cent of the total population. In Northern Tamil Nadu we are found in the urban areas of Chennai, Kanchipuram, Chengalpattu, Sriperumbudur and Vellore.

This is usually followed by Nalangu, which is a casual and informal event.<br><br>

			<div class="normtxt clr lh20 tljust" style="padding-top:10px;">
			Nalangu - wedding games: Nalangu is a tradition that dates back to times when marriages used to occur at a younger age (early teens). This element was incorporated to keep the mood light-hearted and fun for the newly wed young teens. It has stayed on as an integral part of South Indian weddings.<br><br>
			Traditional games include the newly-weds putting their hands into a small bowl to find a small object. The person finding the object first is declared the winner. Other examples of games include breaking papadums over each other's heads. It is an interesting component of the wedding gala.
