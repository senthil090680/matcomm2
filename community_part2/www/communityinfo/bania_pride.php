            <b>Telecom mogul</b><br /><br />
            <img src="http://img.baniyamatrimony.com/images/Baniya_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>Sunil Bharti Mittal is the founder, chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises. The US$7.2 billion turnover company runs India's largest GSM-based mobile phone service. In 2007, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honor. <br /><br />
            Sunil Mittal was born in Punjab. His father, Sat Paul Mittal, was the Member of Parliament (M.P) from Ludhiana.He attended Scindia School at Gwalior and graduated in 1979 from Punjab University, Chandigarh.<br /><br />
            A first generation entrepreneur, Mittal started his first business in April 1976 at the age of 18, with a capital investment of Rs 20,000 borrowed from his father. His first business was to make crankshafts for local bicycle manufacturers. In 1980 he sold his bicycle parts and yarn factories and moved to Mumbai.<br /><br />
            In 1981, he purchased importing licences from exporting companies in Punjab and imported thousands of Suzuki Motors's portable electric-power generators from Japan. The import of generators was suddenly banned by the then Indian Government.<br /><br />
            In 1984, Mittal started assembling push-button phones in India replacing the old fashioned, bulky rotary phones. Bharti Telecom Limited (BTL) was incorporated and entered into a technical tie up with Siemens AG of Germany for manufacture of electronic push button phones. By the early 1990s, Mittal was making fax machines, cordless phones and other telecom gear. In 1992, he successfully bid for one of the four mobile phone network licences auctioned. One of the conditions for the Delhi cellular license was that the bidder have some experience as a telecom operator. So, Mittal clinched a deal with the French telecom group Vivendi.<br /><br />
            He was one of the first Indian entrepreneurs to identify the opportunities in the mobile telecom business. The government in 1994 finally approved his plans and he launched services in Delhi in 1995, when Bharti Cellular Limited was formed to offer cellular services under the brand name AirTel. Within a few years Bharti became the first telecom company to cross the 2-million mobile subscriber mark. Bharti also brought down the STD/ISD cellular rates in India under brand name 'Indiaone'. IndiaOne was India's first private national as well as the international long-distance service provider, and, thus, became a major factor in Bharti's success by providing services cheaply.<br /><br />
            Mittal has also been working towards educating India through the Bharti Foundation. The foundation has established over 200 schools and libraries in India, as well as providing scholarships for college students. For his work with the foundation Barron's named Mittal number 16 on its 2009 list of the worlds top 25 philanthropists.<br /><br />
            Mittal resides in Delhi. He is married and has three children. He is superstitious about the number 23, as he was born on the 23 and also got married on the 23rd.<br /><br />
