			<b>Rituals before marriage</b><br /><br />
            Pendlikoothuru takes place a day or two before the marriage. In this ceremony, the boy and the girl are smeared with oil and turmeric. They take bath and wear new clothes. The bride dresses up in a saree and wears flowers on her hair and bangles on her hands. The groom usually wears a dhoti. All the assembled married women are presented with betel leaves, sweets, flowers and bangles. This gifting is done to ensure the married women bless the to-be married girl and invite her to become a part of their group.<br /><br />
            Snathakam is an important ritual that takes place a few hours before the actual Muhurtam. It involves only the bridegroom as he has to wear a silver thread on his body.<br />
            Kashi Yatra is an unique ceremony where the boy says at the end of the thread ceremony that he has discarded worldly pleasures and is going to Kashi. This strange but very relevant ceremony is called "KashiYatra" or the journey to Kashi. To stop him from the symbolic departure to Kashi, the girl's brother requests him to stay on. For this he also offers his sister in marriage.<br /><br />
            Mangala Snaanam or the auspicious bath takes place on the wedding day, at dawn. This bath is taken by both the bride and the groom individually. Such a bath implies the purification of one's physical self before proceeding for the marriage rituals.<br /><br />
            The Aarti ceremony is peculiar to the Indian marriages. It is performed in almost all the marriages, with slight modifications. During the aarti, the family members apply oil on the groom and the girl and do aarti around them. It is done for several reasons, one could be to safeguard the couple from bad planetary influences, bad omens and other evil.<br /><br />
            <b>Gauri Pooja</b><br />
            After having the bath, the bride worships the goddess Gauri. Gauri is the Mother Durga who symbolizes divine power, energy, woman power and fertility.<br /><br />
            <b>Ganesh Pooja</b><br />
            This is the equivalent of the Gauri Puja performed by the groom at the same time. Ganesha puja is considered auspicious for any important occasion as it ensures the success of the work at hand. <br /><br />
            <b>Kanyadaan</b><br />
            The Telugu marriage ceremony is striking as well as colourful. It has the girl's mama or the maternal uncle carrying the bride in a bamboo basket to the mandap (wedding place). The bride is dressed up in a bright coloured saree and precious jewellery.
According to custom, the girl would carry some betel leaves, betel nuts, a coconut, sandalwood stick and a red pumpkin. During the marriage, a curtain is placed between the bride and groom, so that they do not see each other till the ceremony is completed.
<br /><br />
At the end of the wedding, the father and mother of the bride cleanses the boy's feet with water. In the Telugu community, the groom ties the Mangalsutra around the neck of the bride with three knots.<br /><br />
<b>Kanya Daan Akshata</b><br />
At the end of the Mangalsutra ceremony, the couple put garlands around each other's necks. And all those assembled shower flower petals and rice. This is called Akshata, the offering of uncooked, turmeric-coloured rice.<br /><br />
<b>Rituals after Marriage</b><br /><br />
<b>Griha Pravesh</b><br />
This is a common marriage ritual where the bride is made to enter the groom's house with much fanfare. The two mangalsutras are united on a common thread 16 days after the wedding, with a few black or golden beads between the two plates so that they do not clash with each other. This symbolizes harmony between the two families. The number 16 is considered a divine number in Hinduism and 16 days are symbolic of the time period that the bride has taken to know and understand her husband's family. <br /><br />
As is common with most Hindu ceremonies, the bride takes a bath and wears a new sari. Any elder from the family or the husband himself then unites the two mangalsutras on a common thread <br /><br />
<b>Jeelakarra-Bellamu</b><br />
This is a not so common ritual in Telugu marriage where a paste of cumin seeds and jaggery is made. The bride and the groom apply this paste on each other's hands. It is symbolic of the bride and the groom coming together.<br /><br />
