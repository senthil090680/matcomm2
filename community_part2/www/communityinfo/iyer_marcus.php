            A typical Iyer wedding consists of Sumangali Prarthanai (prayers for a happy and prosperous married life), Nandi (homage to ancestors), Nischayadhartham (Engagement) and Mangalyadharanam (tying the knot). <br /><br />
            The main events of an Iyer marriage include Vratam (fasting), Kasi Yatra (pilgrimage to Kasi), Oonjal (swing), Kanyadanam (placing the bride in the groom's care), Mangalyadharanam, Panigrahanamand Saptapathi (or seven steps - the final and most important stage where the bride takes seven steps supported by the groom's palms thereby finalizing their union). Nalangu usually follows this, which is a casual and informal event.       <br /><br />

            <b>Special cultural nuances:</b><br />
            Nalangu - wedding games: Nalangu is a tradition that dates back to times when marriages used to occur at a younger age (early teens). This element was incorporated to keep the mood light-hearted and fun for the newly wed young teens. It has stayed on as an integral part of South Indian weddings.<br /><br />
            Traditional games include the newly-weds putting their hands into a small bowl to find a small object. The person finding the object first is declared the winner. Other examples of games include breaking papadums over each other's heads. It is an interesting component of the wedding gala.<br /><br />
