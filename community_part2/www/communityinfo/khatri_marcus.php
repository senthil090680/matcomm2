Two small bundles containing betel nuts, tamarind and tiny shells are tied to a red sacred thread called 'mouli' and blessed by the priest. These 'kangans'/bracelets, a symbol of protection for all the wedding rites, are tied to the couple's wrists and remain till the end of all wedding rites.<br /><br />
                <b>Mehndi:</b><br />

                <b>Wedding rituals</b><br />
                The 'Vivah' or marriage ceremonies are commenced with Baraat.<br /><br />
                <b>Baraat:</b><br />
                The groom, attired in an off-white or cream colour sherwani suit, a head gear, 'safa' and a jeweled sword, a family heirloom fixed in his waistband, leaves for the wedding venue mounted on a decorated mare and accompanied by family members and close friends dancing to the tune of a live band. At the entrance of the venue the bride's family gives him a warm welcome.<br /><br />
                <b>Jaimala:</b><br />
                The bride along with her close friends and cousins receives the groom and the pujari performs a small 'puja', after which the couple exchanges garlands. Then they enter the marriage altar erected for the wedding ceremony.Since in the Khatri weddings the wedding rites are performed only after midnight and may last till the early hours of the morning, wedding dinner is served to the guests after the jaimala ceremony. Only very close family relatives and friends stay to witness the actual wedding rites. <br /><br />
                <b>Havan:</b><br />
                The two officiating priests, one from each family, perform a special 'puja'/prayer for the groom as he enters the altar. The couple, their parents and close relatives perform numerous rituals. The main witness to the wedding, 'Havan' or the sacred fire is lit by the priest amidst chanting of Vedic mantras and he offers prayers to the fire for a long healthy, prosperous and happy life for the newly weds. <br /><br />
                <b>Kanyadaan:</b><br />
                In this ritual, the bride with betel leaves, betel nuts, rice grains and flower in her hands stands facing the groom. The priest touches the couple's foreheads with a kalash, while the bride's father touching her hands asks the groom whether he is prepared to accept the bride as his wife for which the groom, grasping her hands, promises protect his new wife.<br /><br />
                <b>Gath Bandhan: </b><br />
                In this ritual, the bride's sair pallu and groom's shawl are tied together and the couple walk around the sacred fire taking their seven marriage vows as the priest recites mantras. After completing the seven 'pheras' the bride moves to the groom's left side. <br />
                <br />
                <b>Post-wedding rituals</b><br />
                <b>Bari Palang:</b><br />
                It is a unique custom in which the couple is taken to the room having the nuptial bed and made to sit on it. After a brief prayer the bride, taking handfuls of rice throws it over her head looking straight. The ladies, who stand behind, try to collect as many rice grains as they can in their sari 'pallus' or 'dupattas'. It is believed that good luck will favor the one who gathers the most. <br /><br />
                At the end of all the wedding ceremonies the parents of the newly weds hug and wish each other. At this time close to daylight, the bride is sent to the groom's house. The next day morning the bride's brother comes to the groom's house to bring her, the groom and his close relatives back to the bride's parental house to take part in a sumptuous breakfast.<br /><br />
                In the last ritual, 'Vidaai', the bride bids a tearful farewell to her parents, close relatives and friends all the while she is showered with flowers and gifts and arrives at her new house in a decorated car.<br /><br />
                <b>Special Customs:</b><br />
                The Khatri wedding ceremonies are quite elaborate and the ceremony known as 'Bedi Lutna' is their specialty, in which young cousins and other children plunder the wedding altar soon after the ceremony by removing all its adornments and toys.<br /><br />
