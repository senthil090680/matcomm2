                On the specified day, the three arumaikaarars (respected elder of the community who actually conducts the marriage), after planting the 'Muhurthakaal', will go to an anthill of white ants, offer prayer, gather sacred earth in three baskets and bring the same to the wedding place. Brahmin priests are not involved in traditional Kongu Vellalar Goundar marriages.<br /><br />
