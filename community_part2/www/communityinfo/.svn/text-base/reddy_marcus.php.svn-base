            The customs and traditions of our community are usually similar to those followed by other communities in Andhra Pradesh.<br /><br />
            <b>Patrika</b><br />
            This is the written marriage contract between the two families. The families of the bride as well as groom consult their respective astrologers and fix the date of
marriage. The marriage contract is placed on an yellow cloth along with fruits, betel nuts, betel leaf and turmeric. The priest chants mantras while the fathers of the  bride and groom exchange the Patrika.

<b>Special cultural nuances:</b><br />
In Telangana, there is a Podamuri or Vastradanam ceremony. In this ceremony, the initial examination of horoscopes takes place at the house of the bride in the presence of the bride's and bridegroom's families. <br /><br />
The astrologer writes his calculations and opinion on a piece of palmyra leaf and hands it over to the bridegroom's relations. If the horoscopes match, a day is
fixed for the ceremony. This date is also written down and handed to the bride's family and to the bridegroom's relations. The astrologer and the bridegroom's party are then invited to a feast in the bride's house. The astrologer also receives gifts in the form of money or cloth.
