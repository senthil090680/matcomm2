				<img src="<?=$confValues['IMGSURL']?>/infopg_mudali1.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" />We are also known as Mudaliyar, Mudali and Moodley in the Tamil language. The word literally means a person of first rank in a feudal society in south India. Most of us are Tamil people with Tamil as our mother tongue.<br><br>
				We are one of the most prominent communities in Tamil Nadu and are known for our flair with words and contributions to the fine arts.<br><br>
				We used to be primarily an agrarian community. But with the passage of time many of us have now taken to business and service sector jobs.<br><br>
				Our community comprises vegetarians as well as non-vegetarians.<br>
				Danseuse Alarmel Valli, Tamil poet Bharathidasan and former chief minister Arignar Anna belong to our community.
