			<b>Dr. Singh: Liberator of the Indian economy</b><br><br>
			<img src="http://img.sikhmatrimony.com/images/Sikh_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>The Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh is probably the most qualified prime minister India has ever had. He is well regarded for his diligence and his academic approach to work, as well as his accessibility and his unassuming demeanour.  
			Dr Singh is also the first Sikh to have reached the country's top legislative position. <br><br>
			Dr Singh is best known as the "liberator" of Indian economy. As the Union Finance Minister in the Narasimha Rao government (1991-96), he liberalised the economy to put India on the path of globalisation. In fact, Dr Singh changed the way India did business. But Rao was not the first prime minister who saw potential in this soft-spoken economist. In 1990, he was handpicked by then Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar as his economic advisor, thereby bringing him into the public eye for the first time. <br><br>
			Earlier, Dr Singh worked as the Deputy Chairman of the Planning Commission from 1985 to 1987 and as the Governor of the Reserve Bank for three years before that. He has also been the Central government's Advisor on Economic Affairs, besides taking international assignments at the International Monetary Fund and the Asian Development Bank. <br><br>
			Having occupied virtually all key positions in India's economic administration, with added international perspective thanks to his stints at the IMF and South-South Commission, it was time for Manmohan Singh to transform himself into a politician.<br><br>
			Dr. Singh was first elected to the Rajya Sabha in 1991, and has represented the Congress there since. In 1999, he contested the Lok Sabha elections from South Delhi, but lost. He was the Leader of the Opposition in the Upper House until becoming the Prime Minister of India.<br><br>
			He has won several awards for his work and contribution to society, including the Padma Vibhushan in 1987, the Euromoney Finance Minister of the year award in 1993 and the Asiamoney Finance Minister of the year award in 1993 and 1994. <br><br>
			Dr Singh was born in Gah, West Punjab, now a part of Pakistan, to Gurmukh Singh and Amrit Kaur on Sep 26, 1932. At the dawn of Independent India in 1947, Manmohan Singh, aged 13, displaced by the partition, came to live with his parents in Amritsar from Gah. Memories of the locals, his neigbours, friends, many of whom live here even now, reflect a man risen from the grassroots, his success built on dedication and merit overcoming odds. <br><br>
			Rajwinder, an old family friend, who lives in the same area even today, told the news agency, ANI: "In the early days, his family faced great problems due to poverty. His father had a petty job, and on days it was so bad, there wasn't even bread in the house to eat. He used to go to school barefeet. They didn't have electricity in the house, so he studied under a street lamp. Very often his family had to go to bed hungry for want of money." <br><br>
			Destiny had big things in store for this studious boy. Dons at Oxford University remember Dr Singh for his quiet nature, hard work and brilliance in producing a thesis on India's exports as a student in the early 1960s. Dr Singh studied for a DPhil in Economics at Nuffield College between 1960 and 1962. He has been an Honorary Fellow of the college since 1994. <br><br>
			Dr Ian Little, who was Dr Singh's college supervisor, told an Indian news agency: "I am fairly surprised about his taking over as the prime minister. When he was here he was very quiet, not the sort who make great politicians. He did not mix a great deal with other students. He was somewhat of a loner." According to Little, even though he was Dr Singh's supervisor, he learnt from him rather than the other way round, about India's export sector. <br><br>
			Dr. Singh was sworn in as Prime Minister on 22nd May after the 2004 general elections and took the oath of office for a second term in 2009. Dr Singh is married to Gursharan Kaur and has three daughters.<br><br>
