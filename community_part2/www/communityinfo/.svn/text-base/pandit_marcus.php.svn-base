			<b>Pre-wedding Rituals</b><br />
            <b>Formal Engagement or Kasamdry:</b> Once the two families agree to the alliance, a formal commitment ceremony takes place called a kasamdry. The family purohits fix the date of the engagement ceremony as per the Kashmiri calendar. <br /><br />
            The ceremony takes place in front of an idol. The elderly persons of both sides meet in a temple and exchange flowers as a sign of celebration. <br /><br />
            <b>Livun:</b> An auspicious day is chosen for the livun, the traditional cleansing of the house before a wedding. On this day, the floors of the Kashmiri mud houses are cleaned and treated with a mixture of mud and water. All the married female members of the family attend the ceremony. The bua or pof (father's sister) of the boy and that of the girl prepare var which has to be distributed to all the neighbours and relatives. They are given cash by the respective parents of the bride and the groom as a token of love. <br /><br />
            <b>Wanvun:</b> During every evening following livun, up to the marriage ceremony, a sangeet (music) session is held where the participants include neighbours and relatives. The guests are served a salted pink tea (called noon or sheer chai) at the end of such singing sessions. <br /><br />
            <b>Maenziraat:</b> The maenziraat ceremony takes place a week prior to the wedding. It begins with krool khaarun, a ceremony Maenz (henna) which involves decorating the door of the houses of the prospective bride and the groom by their respective aunts (father's sister). <br /><br />
            <b>Thread Ceremony (yagneopavit):</b> If the Janayu or thread ceremony has not been performed earlier for the groom, then it is conducted a few days before the wedding. If the ceremony is conducted post-adolescence he wears a thread of 6 strands as opposed to 3 worn if the ceremony was performed in his younger days.<br /><br />
            <b>Divagone:</b> The divagone is a ceremony that marks the transition of the bride and the groom from brahmacharya ashram to grihastha ashram. <br /><br />
            The purohit conducts the ceremony in front of a sacred fire. The ornaments and utensils that will be given to the bride by her family are also placed in front of the fire. An essential part of the rituals is the kanishran. This involves bathing the boy /girl with a mixture of water, rice, milk and curd. Flowers are also showered over the boy/girl. They change into a new set of traditional attire following the kanishran. <br /><br />
            <b>The Wedding Rituals</b><br />
            <b>Ceremony at the groom's house:</b> The groom's paternal uncle helps him to tie the gordastar (turban).  While the groom's turban is being tied, a plate of rice containing money (zung) is touched on his right shoulder.  Before the marriage procession leaves for the bride's house, the groom must stand on a vyoog (a decorative pattern made of rice flour and colours). The groom and his party (baraat) leave for the bride's house by car.<br /><br />
            <b>Reception Ceremony:</b> The father of the bride and the groom exchange jaiphal or nutmeg. The bride's maternal uncle has to carry her out to the place where vyoog has been prepared and where the groom is made to stand. The eldest female member of the family or the bride's mother performs puja with lamps made of wheat flour and offers nabad to the bride and the groom and kisses them on the forehead. <br /><br />
            Two rice pots are given away to the poor. The couple is led by the family purohit to the door. He performs a small ceremony here called dwar pooja before leading them to the lagan mandap.<br /><br />
            <b>Food served:</b> The relatives and friends of the groom are served kahwa followed by a vegetarian meal served in earthen kiln-baked pots (called tabhe) As many as 21-25 dishes are prepared for the guests. <br /><br />
            <b>The wedding ceremony (Lagan):</b> The purohit performs the rituals before a sacred fire. The groom and the bride are asked to see each other through the images formed in a mirror. They are made to hold hands in a firm grip and their hands are covered with a cloth. This in Kashmiri is called Athwas. A mananmal, golden thread, is tied to their foreheads. The left foot of the bride and groom are placed on a kajwat or grinding stone.
After this, they take seven rounds around the sacred fire. The wedding ceremony is followed by a vegetarian dinner with rice. The bride and groom are made to eat from the same plate.
<br /><br />
Posh Puza: At the end of the marriage ritual, a red cloth is placed on the head of the bride and the groom and all the people around offer them flowers (posh) to the accompaniment of Veda mantras. This is called worshipping the couple with flowers. The newly-weds must stand on the vyoog while the eldest female member of the bride's family offers them nabad thrice and kisses them on the forehead. <br /><br />
Welcoming the newly-weds: In a lighter vein, the groom's eldest aunt does not allow the newly-weds entry into their home until she is given cash or jewellery. The couple must stand on a specially created vyoog and have nabad, offered by the groom's eldest aunt or mother. <br /><br />
<b>Post-wedding Rituals</b><br />
<b>Satraat:</b> The bride visits her parents in the evening. Her husband and a couple of children, probably those of her sister-in-law, accompany her. The parents of the bride gift her a set of new clothes and some salt and cash. The groom is also presented with new clothes including a dusa (six yard pashmina shawl). <br /><br />
<b>Phirlath:</b> This is the ceremony that takes place when the couple visit the bride's parents for the second time. Once again, they are given new clothes to mark the occasion.<br /><br />
<b>Roth Khabar:</b> On a Saturday or Tuesday after the wedding, the bride's parents send a roth or a traditional, long freshly baked cake (bread decorated with nuts), to their son-in-law's family. <br /><br />
<b>Gar Atchun:</b> This is a reception held at the girl's place. The bride's brother and sister come to the marital home and escort the bride back to her parent's home for one day. This ritual is known as the Gar Atchun. It marks the beginning of a fruitful and happy life for the couple and their families.<br /><br />
