			Kayasthas mostly belong to the states of U.P., Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Kayasthas also migrated to various other parts of the country. No complete numbers are available on their total population.<br /><br />
            <b>Pre-wedding rituals:</b><br />
            In a hardcore kayasth wedding, the ceremony starts with lagun. A formal invitation in the form of a lagun patrika is sent by the bride's family to the groom's. This is accompanied with a silver-covered coconut, betel nuts and gold-covered barley, clothes for the groom and his family, sweets, dry fruits and fruits are other necessary accompaniments. It is presented to the groom after the Ganesha Puja.<br /><br />
            <b>Tikhati Mejwani:</b><br />
            Among non-vegetarian Maharashtrians, especially CKP community, a non-veg feast is organised at both the quarters separately for the close relatives within a day or two after the wedding. Typically, the main dish is mutton-vade or mutton biryani and liquor may be served before the food. In olden days, even women used to sip liquor from small silver bowls, which was called nathi vagdya karane i.e. to take aside nose rings to facilitate the sips.<br /><br />
            Another amusing custom is where the groom, the bride and all brother and sister-in-laws in the family arm themselves with twigs in which the women attack the men, who are supposed to defend themselves. It's a fun ceremony with men and women of all ages participating and reliving memories of their own marriage ceremony.<br /><br />
            Later, 'Shri Satya Narayana Katha' is recited to give thanks to Lord Vishnu for the successful culmination of all ceremonies.<br /><br />
            <b>Farisht:</b><br />
            After sagaai (engagement), the date of marriage is fixed in an auspicious hour as advised by pundits and after consulting horoscope of the bride and groom. Once the marriage date is fixed the groom's family, sends a list of their relatives to the bride's house comprising names of family Gods and Goddesses, names of the respected elders and other relatives including their relation to the groom. This list is known as farisht, which is prepared in style and written in poetry verses. The bride's parents then begin to make clothes for the relatives on the groom's side according to their budget and write small verses on the dress indicating the name and the relation to the groom. The bride's parents also stitch clothes for their daughter. Similarly, the groom's parents stitch clothes and buy jewellery for their daughter-in-law.<br /><br />
            <b>Bhaat Niyuatena:</b><br />
            The beginning of marriage preparations commence with the ritual of Bhaat Niyuatena, where relatives are invited to grace the marriage and their blessings to the new couple.<br /><br />
            <b>Mehndi:</b><br />
            After Bhaat Niyuatena, on the day before marriage there is a custom of putting mehndi on the palm of the bride and groom. This is accompanied with ganaa bajana and dance. On the day of marriage, the bride after taking bath in the morning, wears a pink saree and visits the temple with her friends and sisters to worship Goddess Parvati. <br /><br />
            Wedding rituals<br /><br />
            <b>Jaimaala</b><br />
            In this ritual, the groom and the bride exchange garlands. At the auspicious time, the groom is made to stand on a higher pedestal and the bride's maternal uncle assists in taking three rounds around the boy and garlanding him. The exchange of garlands and the adorning of mangalsutra marks the marriage<br /><br />
            <b>Joota Choopai:</b><br />
            During the wedding, the groom's sister-in-laws hide his shoes. They return the shoes only after he presents them with a token amount. <br<br />
            <b>Pheras</b><br />
            As per tradition seven pheras are performed - three outer and four inner rounds, around the sacred fire. On completion of the Pheras the groom applies sindoor(vermilion) in the mang (hair parting) of his bride with his ring.<br /><br />
            <b>Post-wedding rituals</b><br /><br />
            <b>Tani khulai:</b><br />
            In this ritual of Tani khulai, the groom opens the knot of a sacred cloth for which his in-laws present him with some cash and gift.<br /><br />
            <b>Vida:</b><br />
            In this ritual, the bride bids a tearful adieu to her family as she proceeds to her new home. <br /><br />
            Dwar rookai:<br />
            When the groom reaches his home with the bride, all his sisters greet them and block the entrance seeking cash to allow them inside. On receiving satisfactory amount from the groom, they allow the newly married couple to enter their home. <br /><br />
            <b>Roohuumai:</b><br />
            In this ritual, elders from the groom's side present jewellery and gifts to the newly married couple. In return, the newly married bride observes the 'paaon parai' ritual where she seeks the blessings of all elders by touching their feet and also presents them with gifts. Next day, as per convenience the convenience of the family the 'Satya narayan ki katha' is performed.<br /><br />
            <b>Dhol Poojan:</b><br />
            In this ritual, the bride along with the groom visits her parent's place and shows them the jewellery that she had received as gift. And the bride's family presents the newly married couple with a pair of clothes. The bride applies teeka for her brother and leaves for her new house. After a year of marriage the groom's sister breaks open the coconut presented at the time of wedding.<br /><br />
            <b>Special cultural nuances:</b><br />
            Kayasthas practice family exogamy and caste endogamy preferring to marry only within their sub-castes. The individuals of same clan cannot intermarry, while those of same caste and different clans can marry. Thus an individual from Srivastava sub-caste and Pandey clan should not marry another Pandey of the same sub-caste but can marry an individual belonging to another clan of the same sub-caste.<br /><br />
