His long hair adds to the flamboyance of this Rajput from Ranchi. Mahi is another name by which he is called by his fans. <br><br>
			Dhoni was the youngest of three children born to Pan Singh and Devki Devi in 1981. His father worked for Mecon and moved to Ranchi from Almora.<br><br>
			While at DAV, Ranchi, he was the goalkeeper of the school team and excelled in badminton too. His focus shifted to cricket, after the football coach, Banerjee, sent him to play cricket for a local club. <br><br>
			Dhoni became the captain of the Indian side in 1997 and has proved to be extremely successful in all versions of the game. Overshadowing Sehwag at the crease is almost impossible. But that is exactly what Dhoni did in only his fifth ODI, against Pakistan at Vishakapatnam. He blasted a quickfire 148 off just 123 balls and followed that up with a huge 183 not out at Jaipur against Sri Lanka, when he broke Adam Gilchrist's record for the highest score by a wicketkeeper in ODIs. He made an instant impact at the Test level too, pounding 148 at Faisalabad, in only his fifth Test. <br><br>
			Dhoni was elevated to the vice-captaincy of the one-day squad for the tour of England and Ireland in 2007 and, soon after, was appointed captain of the Twenty20 squad for the World Championship in South Africa. An exciting title triumph marked him out as a leader for the future and he was handed over the reins of the one-day side in September 2007 after Rahul Dravid decided to step down as captain. <br><br>
			It didn't take long for him to shine, claiming India's first tri-series triumph in Australia. He captained Chennai Super Kings in the IPL and helped the team lift the trophy in 2010. As a stop-gap Test captain, he was credited with leading India to their biggest ever win in terms of runs against Australia in Mohali. <br><br>
			Dhoni's spectacular performance with the bat propelled him to the No. 1 slot in the One Day International (ODI) Cricket rankings of the International Cricket Council (ICC) in 2005-06. <br><br>
			On September 24, 2007, Dhoni led India to its second World Cup victory in the breath-taking finals against Pakistan and equaled the rare feat of leading India to a World Cup cricket trophy achieved by Kapil Dev in 1983. <br><br>
			Under his captaincy, the ODI team maintained a winning streak for an enviable period of time. First off, the team defeated Australia consecutively in 2 final matches of the Commonwealth Bank Series played in March 2008. In the first final, Australia scored 239 for the loss of 8 wickets in 50 overs. India bounced back with 242 runs in just 45.5 overs for the loss of 4 wickets. Sachin Tendulkar was the highest scorer with 117 not out, while Dhoni scored 15 not out. In the second final, India scored 258 runs for the loss of 9 wickets in 50 overs with Sachin again being the largest contributor with 91 runs. Dhoni scored 36 not out in the innings. The Australian team crashed out at 249 runs with 2 balls remaining, and India became the winner of the championship. <br><br>
			In the India tour of Sri Lanka in Jan-Feb 2009, India simply washed out Sri Lanka with a 4-1 win in the ODIs while they also crushed Sri Lanka in the single Twenty-20 match played between the two countries. In this series, Dhoni was the highest scorer in the 4th ODI played on Feb 5, 2009. He scored 94 runs from 96 balls in the match. <br><br>
			Then again in the India Tour of New Zealand in 2008-09, India played Test, ODI and Twenty-20 Series against New Zealand. In the Test series, India won 1 match out of 3 while 2 were drawn. Dhoni scored a total of 155 runs in the series with his highest score of 56 not out. While in the ODI Series, India defeated New Zealand by 3-1, as 1 match out of the 5 matches went without any result. In this series, Dhoni scored 184  runs with the highest of 84 not out. <br><br>
			Dhoni's heroes are legend Sachin Tendulkar and Aussie wicket-keeper batsman Adam Gilchrist. He is a film buff and is a fan of Amitabh Bachchan and Angelina Jolie. Sholay is his favourite movie. He is crazy about bikes and owns the world's fastest bike. Is sold on butter chicken masala and naan.<br><br>
