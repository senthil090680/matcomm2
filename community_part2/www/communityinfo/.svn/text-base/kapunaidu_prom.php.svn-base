Our community name 'Kapu' or 'Kaapu' in Telugu means 'Protector' and the title 'Naidu' means 'leader'. We are the descendants of the Kaampu tribe, which migrated from Kampilya, Mithila and Ayodhya and speak Telugu. We were the earliest inhabitants of the Deccan region, who migrated from the north, cleared forests for agriculture and built settlements. We are referred to as Kaampu in the ancient texts.<br /><br /></div>
