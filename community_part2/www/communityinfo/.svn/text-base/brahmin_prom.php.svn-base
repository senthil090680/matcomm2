<div align="left" style="text-align: justify;" class="clr">We are also called 'Vipra' (learned) and Dvija (twice-born). Our roots go back to 6000 B.C which is called the Vedic period. We can trace our lineage to the seven rishis (saptarshi) who are recognized as the mind-born sons of the creator Brahma. Historically, our community has played a key role in defining and giving meaning to the Hindu way of life and holding together the diverse elements of society. The influence our community has in religious, social and cultural matters continues to this day. World renowned scientists and Nobel laureates Dr S. Chandrasekhar and Sir C.V. Raman and legendary mathematicians like Arya Bhata and Bhaskara were Brahmins.<br /><br /></div>
