This is almost identical with the dialect of the Iyers with whom we are often confused though we sport a 'namam' as our castemark while they apply 'vibhuti'.Our brethren in Karnataka speak a dialect that has a significant Kannada substrate. In southern Andhra Pradesh Iyengars speak both Tamil and Telugu.<br /><br /></div><div class="normtxt1 clr2 padb5">
