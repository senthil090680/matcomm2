                The first step in a Maratha wedding is Lagnaach Bedi or finding a suitable match Var (Groom) or Vadhu (Bride) from a family of equal standing. The patrikas (horoscopes) of the boy and the girl are compared and `Guna Milan' (matching point) is assessed. The horoscope can be considered only if 16 or more `gunas' match.<br /><br />
                Then Baithak, a meeting between the elders of two families happens. The parents and close relatives discuss on the various matters regarding the wedding ceremony. The Mahurat (auspicious date and time) for the wedding is deliberated. <br /><br />
                A Maratha wedding takes place in the morning.  <br /><br />
                <b>Special Marital Customs: List of ceremonies</b><br />
                <b>Pre-wedding</b><br />
                <b>Sakhar Puda</b><br />
                A packet of sugar (sakar) is exchanged by both families to celebrate the engagement of the couple. <br /><br />
                <b>Wang Nischay /Kelvan</b><br />
                It is a formal engagement ceremony where pooja is performed for the ancestral deities of both the groom and brides' side. All relatives and family members of the bride and groom are respectively invited for this ceremony followed by a feast.<br /><br />
                <b>Simant Puja </b><br />
                Simant means limits. Therefore, the groom and the marriage party (bharati) are welcomed at the outer limits of the village and the bride's mother washes the groom's feet in a plate, puts kumkum tilak and akshata (turmeric stained rice) on groom's head, does aarti and offers madhupak (mixture of honey and curd). Groom's family members are also offered the madhupak. The groom is then gifted a trousseau like suit, jewelry etc... Meanwhile, the groom's mother and female relatives go to the bride's place and give her five sarees, jewelry etc. <br /><br />
                This is followed by a special lunch. Sometimes this pooja is done on the day of the wedding only.<br /><br />
                <b>Haldi Chadavane</b><br />
                On wedding eve, five suvasinis (married ladies), dip mango leaves held in separately in both the hands in turmeric paste and apply it fort on feet, then on knees, then on the shoulders and finally on the forehead of the bride. This is done three times. Then a haldi bath is given to her. <br /><br />
                In order to apply the haldi, the bride is made to sit on a small table. She then receives a blouse piece and coconut tambool in her sari's pallu, after which, haldi is applied all over her body.<br /><br />
                Same is done to the groom. Sometimes, Ushti halad (leftover turmeric paste) of the groom is applied to the bride. <br /><br />
                Significance of this ritual is that haldi is a natural antiseptic and purifies hence on its application one can be free of all diseases. After the haldi ceremony both the bride and the groom are not allowed to go outside.<br /><br />
                <b>Chuda</b><br />
                Similar to bridal shower, chuda is a ceremony where the bride and her friends get to have fun wearing green bangles. Amidst song, dance and gaiety, each girl gets to wear the color she likes. <br /><br />
                The bride is given green bangles and she wears them interspersed with gold, pearl or diamond bangles depending on their social status. Green signifies auspiciousness symbolic of new life, creativity and tranquility. <br /><br />
                Each community has its own designs and order of wearing a chuda like Pichchodis, Patlis, Gotes, Bangdi, Phul Bangdi, Tode etc. Pearls are a favorite among Maharashtrians.<br /><br />
                The bride can remove the chuda only one month after the wedding. Married women of Maharashtra can be seen wearing such chudas for all festivals and religious occasions.<br /><br />
                <b>Wedding</b><br />
                <b>Sankalp</b><br />
                Though previously this used to be on the previous day, these days the Sankalp ceremony takes place on the actual wedding day itself.<br /><br />
                The parents of both the bride and the groom announce the marriage in the respective places. This is witnessed by a priest.<br /><br />
                <b>Ganesh Puja</b><br />
                On the wedding day morning, a special pooja is done to lord Ganesha, the remover of all obstacles. He is invoked and His blessings are sought for the smooth conducting of the wedding. Lord Ganesha is invoked at the beginning of all new ventures. It holds special significance for Maharashtrians.<br /><br />
                <b>Gowrihar Puja</b><br />
                The setting up of Muhurta patra to measure time heralds the beginning of the actual ceremony – the auspicious moment of the marriage. Trickling of water drop by drop counts the seconds while the bride draped in  a traditional yellow or green saree and half moon painted on her forehead (for luck), worships Goddess Parvati, who is supreme of marital bliss. The bride continues praying to the Goddess till the moment she is called to the mandap.<br /><br />
                <b>Wedding ritual</b><br />
                Once the auspicious time approaches the bride is escorted to the mandap by her maternal uncle. Both the bride and the groom should see each other before the wedding and antarpat ceremony (where a silk partition is placed between the couple) takes place. After chanting of mantras the antarpat is removed.  This is followed by elders showering akshata over the couple.<br /><br />
                The bride and the groom exchange garlands and go around the sacred fire seven times (Saat pheras or Saptapadi). <br /><br />
                <b>Laxmi Narayan Puja</b><br />
                Both the bride and the groom are worshipped as Goddess Lakshmi and Lord Narayan and after the completion of marriage ceremony.<br /><br />
                <b>Jhal Phirawne</b><br />
                More commonly known as Kanyadan, the Jhal Phirwane is when the father gives his girl's hand to the boy. <br /><br />
                A dish made out of cane with 21 lit diyas is placed on the bride's head for the first time.  After Kanyadaan, the groom ties the mangalsutra and applies sindoor on the forehead. In return, the bride applies a chandan tilak on the groom's forehead. <br /><br />
                <b>Post Wedding</b><br />
                <b>Reception</b><br />
                The traditional wedding feast ensues.<br /><br />
                Changing the bride's name<br /><br />
                This is one aspect exclusive to Marathi weddings. The bride's name is change after her wedding. This ceremony is held at the groom's house. The phrase `Om Ganeshaya Namaha' and the ancestral deity's name are inscribed by the groom and then the bride's new name is traced in a plateful of rice.<br /><br />
                <b>Varat</b><br />
                A poignant scene where the bride bids goodbye to her family. After seeking the blessings of the elders in the bride's side, the newly weds move to a procession of band and fireworks towards the groom's house.<br /><br />
                <b>Grihapravesh </b><br />
                At the groom's house the mother of the boy welcomes the couple at the threshold and washes their feet with milk and water followed by an Aarti. The bride then puts out her right foot and tips over a rice filled vessel. At this juncture the bride is considered to be an incarnation of Lakshmi, the Goddess of wealth and the spilling of grains inside the marital home is supposed to bring the family prosperity and fortune.<br /><br />
                The bride then dips her feet in a watery kumkum paste and places them on a white sheet spread before her. This is considered as the steps of Goddess Lakshmi. <br /><br />
                <b>Suun Mukh Baghne</b><br />
                This ritual is significant because it indicates that the groom's mother should consider her daughter-in-law as if she were her own daughter. `Sunn' means daughter-in-law; `baghne' means look and `mukh' means face. The groom's mother first looks at her daughter's face, and then she looks at her own face in the mirror. Thereafter, she combs her daughter-in-law's hair.<br /><br />
                <b>Tend Dune and Valhi Bet</b><br />
                Tend Dune held on the next day after the wedding is when the groom's mother gifts the bride a sari and jewelry made of pearl. <br /><br />
                Vyahi Bhet is a reciprocation wherein the bride's father gives the groom a silver gift.<br /><br />
                Tond dhune is conducted on the next day after the wedding. The groom's mother presents a sari and jewelry made of pearl, to the bride. In order to reciprocate the affection shown, Vyaho Bhet - the bride's father presents the groom a gift made of silver.<br /><br />
                Both the bride and the groom are dressed in traditional Maharashtrian attire. The bride wears green colored paithani type of saree, seven pearl studs, green bangles, toe rings, pearl and bead nath (nose ring) and a bright bindi. The groom is dressed in dhoti or sherwani or a salwar/kurta.<br /><br />
                <b>Tikhati Mejwani</b><br />
                This holds significance for non-vegetarian Maharashtrians, where a sumptuous non-veg feast is served on both the bride and groom's side for two days.<br /><br />
                <b>Halad Utaravane</b><br />
                This is the reverse of the halad chadavane ceremony performed during the pre-wedding ritual. Five suvasinis do this to signify that the couple is now free to go out. <br /><br />
