                The life and career of Srini Koppolu, Managing Director, Microsoft India Development Centre (MIDC) is a source of inspiration for many young IT professionals. The journey from his hometown in Ongole, Andhra Pradesh to Redmond in the US is an absorbing story. For Koppolu himself, the two major milestones in his career have been joining Microsoft at Redmond and setting up its Hyderabad facility.<br /><br />
                Srini was the youngest in his family. His father was a tobacco merchant who passed away when he was just two. He studied at the Municipal High School in Ongole.  He had never heard of the  IITs or the migration path of engineers to the US. His ultimate goal was to study at the Andhra University and he fulfilled his desire by securing a seat in mechanical engineering at the institution. Later, Srini did his MS in Computer Science from the University of Louisiana, US. Srini has two sisters and a brother. <br /><br />
                Opting for Computer Science was a turning point in his life. He joined Microsoft in 1988 and spent a decade at the Redmond facility developing products.
Srini held various positions at Redmond including development lead and development manager in different product groups. He has been a key contributor to the development of Microsoft Office and Windows. He designed Microsoft's Component Technology called COM that resulted in a revolution of component-based development in the software industry. Srini also worked on Office 95 and Office 97, and is one of the creators of the office core infrastructure group. He was also responsible for the Webfeatures in Office and designed the architecture for componentising Internet Explorer 3.0. Koppolu believes in innovative ideas and prefers to work on new technologies.
<br /><br />
After working for about 10 years at Redmond, Srini returned to India in August 1998 to set up the India Development Centre. It started with 20 professionals. Its strength has risen to 500.<br /><br />
"If you do not know where you are going, how do you realise it when you get there? Industry leaders and experts alike need to keep their eyes on the target. If they want their plan to work, they must work their plan," says Srini advising young engineering graduates to focus on their career. According to him, there is a need for every IT graduate to develop his own expertise and compete in the industry. Young engineers with specific skill sets can grab good opportunities in the IT industry. <br /><br />
For a man who has very little time for leisure he always tries to spend a few hours with his family-his wife Pratima and two children. Srini attributes his success to principles of honesty and integrity, emotional empathy and self-criticism. He is still close to his childhood friends from Ongole and his batchmates, both in India and the US. <br /><br />
