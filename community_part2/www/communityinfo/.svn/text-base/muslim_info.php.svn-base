				The 'Nikah'-Urdu word for marriage is a grand event celebrated over a five day period replete with rituals and customs. A Muslim wedding can happen at any time of the day and there is no such thing as 'auspicious time' or 'muhurat'. The wedding ceremony usually takes place either in the bride's or the groom's house. But, nowadays, for want to space, it is conducted in marriage halls.<br><br>
				Nikah is a civil contract between the man and the woman for conjugal life and for progeny. Both the Nikah and its dissolution are guided by religious dictum.

He appoints two men as witnesses - 'gawah' on behalf of the groom to receive Nikah orders from the bride's side.

			The groom's Ijab (proposal) has to be 'Qubul' (accepted) by the bride. For the marriage to be legalized, mutual consent of both the bride and the groom is very important.<br>
