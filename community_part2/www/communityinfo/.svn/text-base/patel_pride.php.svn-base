For Karsanbhai Khodidas Patel has become something of a cult figure in the Patel community, next only to Dhirubhai Ambani, the legendary founder of Reliance. And the story of Nirma has become a classic as a marketing case-study.<br /><br />
            Karsanbhai Patel is the man behind the hugely successful brand, Nirma and is the founder of the Rs. 2500 crore Nirma group with major interests in detergents, soaps and cosmetics. <br /><br />
            In 2005, Forbes listed his net worth as USD $640 million. Karsanbhai is interested in education as well and founded a leading engineering college, the Nirma Institute of Technology.<br /><br />
            Karsanbhai is also known as Dr. K.K. Patel and was born in 1945 in Ruppur, Mehsana, Gujarat. He came from a humble farmer family and started out as a lab assistant in the geology and mining department of the government of Gujarat. In 1969, at the age of 25, Karsanbhai Patel set up a small-scale enterprise to manufacture a quality detergent powder, using indigenous technology. He named the detergent powder Nirma after daughter Nirupama and the product was sold at a third of the prevailing price.<br /><br />
            At that time the domestic detergent market was limited only to the premium segment and was dominated by the big MNCs. Karsanbhai Patel started door-to-door selling of Nirma and priced it at Rs 3 per kg. Nirma revolutionized the entire detergent powder segment and in a short time created an entirely new market segment in the domestic detergent sector market. It gave the bigger established brands a run for their money and soon occupied the top market share. <br /><br />
            Nirma was made of an innovative formulation and was phosphate free and hence environment friendly, and the process of manufacturing was labour intensive, which offered large scale employment. The MNCs were later compelled to copy Nirma's manufacturing and marketing techniques.<br /><br />
            After establishing its leadership in economy-priced detergents, Nirma entered the premium segment, launching toilet soaps Nirma bath and Nirma beauty soap and premium detergent Super Nirma detergent. Ventures into shampoo and toothpaste were not as successful, but the edible salt Shudh is doing well. Nirma beauty soap is one of the leading toilet soaps. Overall, Nirma has a 20 per cent market share in soap cakes and about 35 per cent in detergents. Nirma also has successful operations in neighbouring countries.<br /><br />
            In 1995, Karsanbhai started the Nirma Institute of Technology in Ahmedabad, which has grown into a leading engineering college in Gujarat. An Institute of Management followed, with the entire structure being consolidated under the Nirma University of Science and Technology in 2003, overseen by the Nirma Education and Research Foundation. The Nirmalabs education project, aimed at training and incubating entrepreneurs, was launched 2004.<br /><br />
            In 2001, Karsanbhai was awarded an honorary doctorate by Florida Atlantic University, recognizing his exceptional entrepreneurial and philanthropic accomplishments.<br /><br />
            In 1990, the Federation of Association of Small Scale Industries of India, New Delhi, awarded him the 'Udyog Ratna' award. The Gujarat Chamber of Commerce felicitated him as an 'Outstanding Industrialist of the Eighties'. He has served twice as Chairman of the Development Council for Oils, Soaps and Detergents. Karsanbhai was honoured with the Padma Shri Award for the year 2010.<br /><br />
            Karsanbhai's two sons and son-in-law now hold top management posts in the Nirma organization. Rakesh K Patel looks after procurement and logistics, Hiren K Patel, chemical engineer and MBA, heads marketing and finance, while Kalpesh Patel is in human resources and Healthcare Industry (Nirlife healthcare).<br /><br />
