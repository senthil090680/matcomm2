			<b>Scripture reading, music and more</b><br><br>
			Catholics are the followers of Christian Faith founded by Jesus and his Apostles, the chief being Simon Peter. The Vatican is the Head of the Roman Catholic Church who is vested with powers ordained by the Lord to preside over all matters pertaining to the Catholic faith. In India, there are different sects of Catholic faith like the Syrian Christians of Malabar, Anglo Indians, Goan Christians... they could be of different sects, affiliated to different parishes but they are essentially Catholics whose head is the Vatican.<br><br>
			<b>Marital Tradition:</b><br><br>
			Unlike Hindu marriages where horoscopes are compared for a suitable match, in Catholic weddings, Church is the central point. There is a marriage registry in the Church where one can register for a bride or a groom. This registry is networked among other parishes affiliated to a Cathedral. For instance, in Chennai all the churches come under the Chennai Cathedral. The pastor plays a very crucial role in solemnizing the match.<br><br>
			The wedding per se is steeped in tradition and ritual. The wedding rite is part of the seven sacraments of Catholic religion. This takes place during the Mass and is known as Nuptial Mass. Held usually in the morning or early afternoon, Nuptial Masses are not scheduled for Holy Thursday or Good Friday or on Sundays when community congregates for prayer. A marriage ceremony is a public ritual in Catholic tradition since it takes place in the Church.<br><br>
			<b>Special Marital Customs - List of Ceremonies</b><br><br>
			<b>Pre-Wedding</b><br><br>
			Engagement<br>
			This is hosted by the bride's parents, where the couple exchange engagement rings blessed by the parish priest. The pastor conducts the engagement ceremony which is encompassed by a brief prayer service. This is only an indicative, affirming of the wedding to take place later.<br><br>
			Announcement (Reading of Banns)<br>
			Once the match is fixed, the Banns are read aloud in the Church for three consecutive Sundays. These are statements proclaiming the proposed wedding between the couple and are announced at Masses and put up as notices in the respective Churches of the bride and the groom. If anybody has opposition against the match, they can come forth and say so.<br><br>
			Attending a Preparatory Course<br>
			The assigned couple has to go for week long Pre-marital classes conducted by the Cathedral. This period is for educating them on the sanctity of marriage as well as to assess their suitability and compatibility to each other.<br><br>
			The Pastor has to give the consent and an approval certificate on their eligibility to get married to each other. Then the wedding is planned.<br><br>
			Bridal Shower<br>
			A final party hosted by the bride as a maiden for her close circle of friends and relatives. It is a hen-party, where the friend shower gifts on the bride to be. Usually, the maid of honor hosts the party.<br><br>
			Bridesmaids' Luncheon party<br>
			The bride hosts this personally as a thank you gesture for her bridesmaids. She gives them gifts and serves the customary pink cake with a thimble hidden inside. Tradition has it that the girl who gets the slice of cake with the thimble will be the next bride.<br><br>
			Bachelors' party<br>
			Similar to bridal party, the stag party is hosted by the Best Man for his the groom and friend on the eve of the wedding. Typically runs wild in the process as the groom bids adieu to his bachelor days. An interesting ritual is breaking of the glass after the toast is made- symbolic tradition to ensure that glasses are not used for a less worthy purpose.<br><br>
			This is a stag party hosted by the groom for his Best Man (closest aide during the wedding) and friends on the eve of his wedding. Usually this is a wild party, and the groom is expected to enjoy his last night as a bachelor. It is customary to raise a toast before the drinking begins in earnest. Sometimes, enthusiastic friends break their glass after the toast is raised. This is part of the tradition to ensure that the glasses are not used for a less worthy purpose.<br><br>
			His and Her's pre-wedding party<br>
			Sometimes, the couple decides to give a combined party instead of separate bridesmaid's and bachelor's parties for their respective friends.<br><br>
			The Rehearsal Dinner<br>
			This is hosted by the groom's family while the expenses for the reception are borne by the bride's side. The dinner per se can be a formal affair at a restaurant or could be an informal get together at home. It is yet another opportunity for both the families to come together and get familiar.<br><br>
			<b>Wedding</b><br><br>
			Welcoming the Bride<br>
			On the Wedding Day, the groom sends a car to pick up the bride. When she arrives the Best Man welcomes her with a kiss each on the cheeks and gifts a bouquet of flowers.<br><br>
			The Wedding Mass<br>
			The groom awaits the bride at the altar. The bride is accompanied by her father to the tunes of 'Here Comes the Bride' and given away in hand to the groom. Both the bride and the groom stand before the priest who welcomes them into the Church and blesses them.<br><br>
			The wedding mass commences with hymns and selected readings from the Bible. The guests are provided with a liturgy for reference to ceremonial proceedings.<br><br>
			Homily<br>
			It is a discourse on sanctity of marriage made interesting with anecdotes and witticisms to make the speech interesting.<br><br>
			The Nuptials During<br>
			The priest poses a few questions to the couple who are sworn to speak the truth under the oath of God. They are asked if they have come by free will into the marriage communion and if they would honor and love each other as husband and wife for the rest of their lives. He also will ask them if they will lovingly accept the children from God and bring them up according to the law of Christ and His church.<br><br>
			Solemn Promise<br>
			The pastor tells the couple to join their right hands and declare their consent before the God and His Church. The couple subsequently takes their wedding vows. The gist of the vow is to be there for each other in sickness and in health; in good times and in bad; promise to cherish, love, respect and honor each other every day of their life till death do them apart. He blesses the couple and proclaims, "May the Lord in His goodness strengthen your consent and fill you both with His blessings. What God has joined together, let no man put asunder."<br><br>
			Blessing & Exchange of Rings<br>
			The priest blesses the Wedding rings and both the bride and the groom exchange them with a promise of unconditional love and fidelity. The Priest vested by the powers of God and His Church pronounces them as 'Husband and Wife'.<br><br>
			Penitential Rite<br>
			This is a moment of austerity where the priest requests the congregation to remain silent for a few minutes and confess to God and one another personal shortcomings, sins and failures and ask for forgiveness and pledge peace and acceptance of grace.<br><br>
			Liturgy of the word<br>
			The couple and their close relatives at the lectern read selected portions from the Bible.<br><br>
			Prayer of the Faithful<br>
			The Father conducts a prayer service exclusively for the couple wherein he calls upon the Lord to bless the couple and pray that their love may nurture and mature into a strong bond. He then prays for their family and friends as well as for the departed souls of the relatives of the couple.<br><br>
			Offertory Procession<br>
			The couple brings various offerings like candles, flowers etc.each of which has significance. Flowers are symbolic of beauty and fragrance of God's creations. The priest then requests the Lord to bless the couple so that they too can spread this beauty and fragrance wherever they go.<br><br>
			After the offerings, the priest gives the couple consecrated bread and wine which represent the body and blood of Jesus Christ. Wine is given only during weddings. The choir sings an offertory hymn.<br><br>
			The Communion Rite<br>
			The congregation receives the holy communion (of bread and wine) and jointly recites the Biblical prayer - Our Father in Heaven...<br><br>
			Nuptial Blessing<br>
			The bride and the groom offer thanksgiving prayer to God and ask for His blessings. The priest gives a final blessing and a prayer marking the conclusion of the ceremony. The congregation also blesses the couple. Both the couple and the priest sign the Church register that serves a legal document of marriage, a copy of which is sent to the Registrar of Marriages and the Vatican.<br><br>
			The Recessional<br>
			Bride and Groom walk as husband and wife down the aisle out of the church while the organ plays the recessional hymn.<br><br>
			<b>Post Wedding</b><br><br>
			The Reception<br>
			The reception that takes place at a nearby hotel or community hall has a lot of dance and music involved. A live band is usually arranged for this purpose to entertain the guests. The newly weds a welcomed with a shower of confetti. They cut a tiered wedding cake and feed each other the first slice. The Toastmaster proposes a toast in honor of the newly weds followed by the Best Man and Maid of Honor speeches. The honor of the first dance goes to the groom. The bride and the groom have the traditional first dance, a waltz. The bride's parents join them and also the Best Man and the Maid of Honor and the groom's parent's follow. Soon, the guests also join in.<br><br>
			Grace is said before beginning dinner. The wedding couple will be the first to leave the reception. The bride before leaving throws her bouquet backwards to bevy of eager damsels hoping to catch the proverbial posy to be the next bride to be.

			<div class="normtxt clr lh20 tljust" style="padding-top:10px;">On the wedding day it is considered ill omen for the groom to see the bride before the wedding. The couple can write their own vows and affirm it at the wedding. This is encouraged because it not only gives a personal touch but also ensures commitment from the concerned persons since they wrote it in the first place.<br><br>
			The Bride customarily wears the 'virginal white' wedding gown, though in present times, ivory and cream are also considered.<br><br>
			Another special significance is the important roles played by the Best Man (of the groom) and Maid of Honor (of the bride). It is the Best Man who greets the bride when she enters the church with a wedding bouquet. The Maid of Honor is usually a married woman (though in present times it need not be) and gets to host the bridal shower in honor of the bride. Both the Best Man and the Maid of Honor get to toast the bridal couple first and make a speech at the Reception.<br><br>
			Another unique feature is the 'throwing of the bouquet' by the bride when she leaves the reception. The girl who catches the posy is the one next to be married. There is usually frenzy and rush to see whom the lucky girl is. It is one of the lighter moments of the wedding.<br><br>
			There are some Indian customs that have been incorporated into the catholic wedding, like the mangalsutra or thali. In the Roman Catholic Saraswat Brahmin Community the thali is known as Piduk. In Syrian Christian community, the groom gifts his bride the wedding saree in the church. This saree is known as 'Mantra Kodi'. The thali is a leaf shaped pendant with a cross engraved on it. It is worn in a thread drawn from the stands of the wedding saree by the groom's sister. This is similar to the Hindu custom, where the groom's sister ties the thali mudichu. Another aspect is the saree instead of the traditional wedding gown.<br><br>
