<b>Rituals After Marriage</b><br />
<b>Griha Pravesh</b><br />
Griha Pravesh is a very common marriage ritual, wherein the bride is made to enter the groom's house with all rites and fanfare.The two mangalsutras are united on a common thread 16 days after the wedding, with a few black or golden beads between the two plates, so that they do not clash with each other. This symbolizes harmony between the two families. The number 16 is considered a divine number in Hinduism and 16 days are symbolic of the time period that the bride has taken to know and understand her husband's family. As is common with most Hindu ceremonies, the bride takes a bath and wears a new sari. Any elder from the family, or the husband himself then unites the two mangalsutras on a common thread<br /><br />
