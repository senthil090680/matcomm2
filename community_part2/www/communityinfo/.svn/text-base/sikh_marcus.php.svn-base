			The Sikh Community<br><br>
			Our community is celebrated for its gallantry, talent pool, business acumen and of course sense of humour. Famous sikhs have brought glory to the country in various fields of human endeavour.<br><br>
			Anand Karaj or blissful occasion is the name given to the sikh wedding ceremony. In essence a sikh marriage is based on the concept of laava. We believe that a successful marriage goes beyond being a union of two bodies, minds and souls to a spiritual union of two individuals. The sole purpose of the union is to work towards becoming "Ek Jot Doe Murti" meaning "one spirit in two bodies".<br><br>
			Marriage rituals<br><br>
			Kurmai or Engagement: The ceremony is usually conducted at the Gurudwara about a week before the marriage. The ceremony begins with the recitation of the Ardas. Thereafter, Kirtans or hymns are sung from Sri Guru Granth Sahib. The ceremony ends with langer or a community meal. With the changing times kurmai is sometimes performed at the groom's residence. In such occasions the bride's family visits the groom's house and gifts are exchanged between the two families.<br><br>
			Maiya: During the celebration of the Maiya, both the bride and the groom are kept confined in their residences. They are not allowed to go out.<br><br>
			Gana: An auspicious red thread is tied to the right wrist of the groom and the left wrist of the bride during the ceremony. Assorted items like cowrie shells, pearls, iron key chains and a small silken bundle containing sugar are tied to the gana worn by the bride.<br><br>
			Vatna and Mehndi: This is celebrated a couple of days before the wedding. vatna, which is essentially a scented powder made of barley flour, turmeric and mustard oil is applied to the bodies of the bride and groom. This is followed by a ritual bath. On the eve of the wedding, which is also known as mehndi ki raat, henna is applied on the hands and feet of the bride.<br><br>
			Gharoli: This is celebrated on the morning of the wedding day. The groom's sister-in-law along with other married women go to a nearby well or tank in the gurudwara and fill the gharoli with water which is later used for the wedding ceremony. <br><br>
			Khare Charna: During this ceremony four girls hold a cloth over the groom's head as he sits on a stool to have his bath.<br><br>
			Chooda Ceremony: The bride's maternal uncle takes her for the choora ceremony. During the ceremony close female relatives make her wear a set of red and white bangles that have been dipped in buttermilk. Kaleeran or golden danglers are tied to the bride’s wrist by female relatives. Then it is time for the bride to finally get ready for marriage. <br><br>
			Ghodhi Chadhna and Milni Ceremony:  This is performed at the groom's house. A floral veil known as the Shera is tied across the groom's forehead by his sisters. Relatives garland the groom with floral and currency garlands. Then the groom mounts the horse while his sister in-law puts kajal in his eyes. Once at the bride's house the elders of both families greet each other. Shabads are sung and the ardaas are recited as the procession enters the Gurudwara. Breakfast is served to the guests.<br><br>
			Lawan Phere: During this the bride and groom sit side by side while the first lavan is recited by the bhajji at the Gurudwara. Once it is over the couple circle the Guru Granth Sahib. They then take their seat and wait for the next Lawan to begin. After the fourth and final lawan the friends and relatives shower flowers on the couple. Then the couple are made aware of their duties and responsibilities as man and wife. Finally  a grand feast is organized for the guests.<br><br>
			Doli: The bride then gets ready to leave for the in-laws house. She throws back rice as she goes symbolizing that she wishes prosperity for the family that she leaves behind.<br><br>
