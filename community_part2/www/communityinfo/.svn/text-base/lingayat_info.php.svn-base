				<img src="<?=$confValues['IMGSURL']?>/infopg_lingayat.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" />We are the largest community in Karnataka, comprising about 21 per cent of the state's population. A significant number of Lingayats are also found in parts of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh bordering Karnataka.<br><br>
				Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Gujarat also have Lingayat population.  In north India, we are called Kashmiri Shaivites or Veerashaivas. Our community wields considerable clout in Karnataka politics. Several influential leaders have been from the Lingayat community.<br><br>
				Our community was founded by Lord Basavanna in the 12th century. It is believed that Basavanna, though born a Brahmin, stood up against the rigid practices of the caste system then prevalent, and started teaching his own philosophy that centered around a casteless society.<br><br>
				Soon, his philosophy began drawing large numbers of people into its fold. Saints like Allama Prabhu, Akka Mahadevi, Channabasavanna also played key roles in founding and promoting the sect.<br><br>
				The rise of Lingayathism opened a new chapter in the annals of Kannada literature. It saw the birth of the Vachana style of literature with the Veerashaiva philosophy at its core.

			<b>A Kannada</b> wedding is a relatively simple affair compared with the weddings conducted in other regions of India. The more common rituals across communities are outlined here.<br><br>
			<b>Pre wedding rituals:</b><br><br>
			<b>Nandi:</b> Performed to ensure that the marriage takes place without any hitch. The first wedding card is placed before the Lord.<br><br>
			<b>Kaashi Yatre:</b> This is a traditional playful ritual. This is a ritual where the groom announces his renunciation of the worldly life and pretends to leave for Kasi on a pilgrimage like a true sanyasin. But his maternal uncle stops him and convinces him to marry the girl chosen for him.<br><br>
			<b>Dev Karya:</b> This ritual is conducted on the day of arrival of the groom's family to the place where the marriage is being conducted. The goods used for the wedding are placed before Lord Ganesha and blessings sought. Haldi is applied on the bride and the groom.<br><br>
			When the groom and his family reach the venue, the married women from the bride's party perform an aarti and lead the bridegroom to the wedding hall.<br><br>
			<b>Wedding rituals:</b><br><br>
			<b>Mandap Puja:</b> The first ritual that is performed on the wedding day. This is a puja performed to make sure the mandap or the marriage hall is made fit for the wedding.<br><br>
			The Var Puja is a ceremony performed when the bride's father brings the groom to the Mandap. The ceremonial washing of the groom's feet by the parents of the bride takes place and a silk dhoti is offered to the groom.<br><br>
			<b>Garlanding ceremony:</b> The bride is escorted by her uncle to the mandap. The bride and the groom stand facing each other with a white cloth between them as the wedding mantra is recited. The white cloth is now removed and the bride and the groom garland each other amidst the chanting of mantras.<br><br>
			<b>Giving away of the bride:</b> 'Dhare Herdu' symbolizes handing over of the bride to the groom. The bride's father takes the groom's hand and places it on the hand of the bride. The groom then holds the bride's hand along with coconut and betel leaves while her father pours water into the groom's hands signifying 'dhara' that now she belongs to the groom.<br><br>
			Saptapadi is the wedding ceremony where the bride and the groom walk seven times around the holy fire 'sapta padi'. The groom's angavastram and the bride's pallav are joined with a nuptial knot during the ceremony.<br><br>
			In Kannada weddings, five women tie the Mangalsutra or the holy thread while the bride groom holds it around the neck of the bride. The couple bows before the elders and seek their blessings.<br><br>
			<b>Post wedding rituals</b><br><br>
			Vidaai ceremony refers to the tearful and ceremonial departure of the bride from her maternal home to her in-laws house. The bride's parents shower her with a lot of gifts.<br><br>
			Graha Pravesh is the ritual of the bride entering her new home. She kicks a kalash full of rice kept at the entrance of the groom's house with her right foot. This ritual signifies that her arrival is bound to bring prosperity and she enters a new phase of her life.
