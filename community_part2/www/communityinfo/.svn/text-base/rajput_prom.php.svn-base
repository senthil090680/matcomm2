Rulers from our martial race are known for their valour and chivalry. Rajput, which has its origin in the Sanskrit word 'rajaputra' means 'son of a king'. Most of the rulers of Indian states between 6th century and 19th century AD belonged to our clan. Maharana Pratap, Chhatrapati Shivaji and Prithiviraj Chauhan are some of the historical luminaries born in our race. Our love for art and architecture manifests itself in the many palaces that you get to see today in Jaipur, Udaipur, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur.<br /><br /></div><div class="normtxt1 clr2 padb5">
