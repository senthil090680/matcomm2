           <img src="http://img.niyogimatrimony.com/images/Niyogi_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>Sripathi Panditharadhyula Balasubrahmanyam or Balu to his countless fans and followers in many countries besides India is one of the leading figures of Indian cinema, particularly in the south Indian movie industry. He has held sway for years as a versatile playback singer in Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Hindi, Tulu, Oriya, Assamese, Badaga, Sanskrit, English, Konkini, Bengali, Marathi and Punjabi.<br /><br />
           He is blessed with a rich melodious voice, a fine range and timbre drenched with honeydew, according to a writer. He entered The Guinness Book of World Records for recording the most number of songs by a male singer and is the first south Indian singer to make a strong mark in the Hindi film industry. <br /><br />
           Also known as SPB, Balasubrahmanyam was born on 4th June 1946 into a Niyogi Brahmin family in Konetammapeta near Nellore, Andhra Pradesh. He is the elder brother of the well-known singer S.P. Sailaja. His father, S.P. Sambamurthy was a fine musician and an excellent exponent of "Harikatha" (an art form combining music and story telling). SPB developed an interest in music very early in his life, studied notations and learnt to play instruments like the harmonium and flute on his own while listening to his father. <br /><br />
           His father wanted him to become an engineer and this brought him to Ananthpur, where he enrolled for the engineering course in JNTU. He discontinued the course due to typhoid and then joined as an associate member of the Institution of Engineers. <br /><br />
           Meanwhile, he also pursued his hobby and won awards at many singing competitions. In 1964, he won the first prize in a music competition for amateur singers organised by the Madras-based Telugu Cultural Organisation and earned an opportunity to sing for music director SP Kodandapani.<br /><br />
           Before he became a full-fledged cinema singer, SPB was the leader of a light music troupe that comprised Anirutta on the harmonium, Ilaiyaraaja on guitar and later harmonium, Baskar on percussion and Gangai Amaran on guitar. He was awarded the 'The Lata Mangeshkar Puraskar' by the Madhya Pradesh government in 1999 and Padmasri by the Indian government in 2001.<br /><br />
           SPB has recorded over 35,000 songs in a span of 40 years, which include film songs and devotional numbers recorded by various recording companies in the country. He has recorded 17 songs in Kannada for the composer Upendra Kumar in Bangalore from 9.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. on February 8, 1981 which is a record. He has recorded 19 songs in Tamil and Telugu in a day and 16 songs in Hindi in a day for music directors Anand and Milind, which again is a record.<br /><br />
           He has also composed music for 45 films in Telugu, Kannada, Tamil and Hindi and acted in an equal number of movies mainly in character roles. SPB has also dubbed for artists like Kamal Haasan , Salman Khan, K. Bhagyaraj , Mohan , Girish Karnad , Gemini Ganesan , Nagesh , Karthik , Raghuvaran and Vinod Kumar.<br /><br />
