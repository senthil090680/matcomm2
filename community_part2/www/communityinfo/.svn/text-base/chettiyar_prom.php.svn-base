	<div align="left" style="text-align: justify;" class="clr">Also called Chetty, Chetti, Setty, Chitty and Shettigar, our community is widely spread across South India. The name of our community is derived from a Dravidian word 'Etti'. It literally means, 'look up, jump up or turn around' hawking goods for sale. We flourished in agriculture and were successful in spices trading too. Chettiars are behind some of the most successful hotels and restaurants in South India. We are known for our culinary skills and our 'Chettinad dishes' are enjoyed by food-lovers across India. Union Home Minister P Chidambaram is a Chettiar. Another well-known Chettiar is AV Meiyappan, the founder of the legendary AVM studios in Chennai.<br /><br /></div><div class="normtxt1 clr2 padb5">
