            <img src="http://img.kayasthamatrimony.com/images/Kayastha_pride.jpg" style="padding-right:12px;float:left;"/>Amitabh Bachchan is one of the most enduring icons of Bollywood and has a global reputation. He was voted 'Superstar of the Millenium' ahead of such luminaries as Charlie Chaplin, Sir Lawrence Olivier and Marlon Brando in an international poll hosted by the BBC. Bachchan is arguably India's greatest ever superstar.<br /><br />
            His nicknames include Big B and Munna. He has also been called a 'One Man Industry', the 'Angry Young Man', Bollywood's Shahenshah, Amith and the Big A. His favourite screen name is Vijay, which he had as his character name in over 20 movies.<br /><br />
            His father Harivansh Rai Bachchan, a noted Hindi poet, considered naming him 'Inquilab' (which means 'revolution') before settling on Amitabh which translates into 'brilliance unlimited'. He is the only actor who achieved at least one hit every year for 15 consecutive years - from 1972 in 'Bombay to Goa' to 1986 in 'Aakhree Raasta'.<br /><br />
            He has played double and triple roles in a number of films. His double role starrers include Adalat (1976), Don (1978), Kasme Vaade (1978), The Great Gambler (1979), Bemisaal (1982), Desh Premee (1982), Satte Pe Satta (1982), Aakhree Raasta (1986), Toofan (1989), Bade Miyan Chote Miyan (1998), Lal Baadshah (1999) and Sooryavansham (1999). Mahaan (1983) had the superstar in a triple role. His biggest superhits include Sholay, Amar Akbar Anthony, Trishul, Don and Deewar.<br /><br />
            Bachchan has often portrayed the role of an angry young man fighting a corrupt establishment -- a theme that had a great appeal in India during that time. The screen-writing duo, Salim-Javed, have been credited with creating this persona. Interestingly, his baritone (since regarded as his biggest asset) once failed to get him a job as a news presenter at All India Radio. <br /><br />
            Bachchan was born in Allahabad and attended Boys' High School in Allahabad followed by Sherwood College in Nainital. He obtained a science degree from Delhi University and started his acting career in 1969 with Saat Hindustani. It was Zanjeer in 1973 that catapulted him to the top ranks of Hindi stars. Bachchan married actress Jaya Bhaduri the same year. He has acted with Jaya in films like Zanjeer, Abhimaan, Sholay, Silsila and Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham. They have two children: Shweta Bachchan Nanda and Abhishek Bachchan. Abhishek, an emerging superstar of Hindi films, is married to the internationally-known actress Aishwarya Rai.<br /><br />
            In 1982, Bachchan was seriously injured while shooting for Coolie. Popular interest in his injury had been so high that when Coolie was released, it isolated and captioned the exact moment when Bachchan was hurt in the stunt scene. In 1984, Bachchan briefly entered politics in support of long-time family friend Rajiv Gandhi. He contested Allahabad's parliament seat against H. N. Bahuguna, a seasoned politician and won. However, his political career was short-lived. He resigned three years before finishing his term.<br /><br />
            The 1990s was a low point in his career. In 1995, Bachchan went into business founding Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Ltd, an entertainment company that specialized in film production and event management. The company did not succeed and Bachchan was pushed into huge debt. <br /><br />
            But he bounced back in the early 2000s by hosting Kaun Banega Crorepati, the Indian version of 'Who Wants to be a Millionaire?' In June 2000, he became the first living Asian to have a wax statue erected in his honor at Madame Tussaud's. <br /><br />
            Here are other nuggets of information about the superstar. <br />
            Did you know that he was a former stage actor, radio announcer and freight company executive in Calcutta?<br />
            He is a chronic asthmatic and reportedly suffers from a rare muscular disorder known as myasthenia gravis and vitiligo.<br />
            Bachchan is a pure vegetarian and teetotaller. He hates the word Bollywood that describes the Hindi film industry.<br />
            He was for a long time the highest paid actor in India. He was considered 'finished' in the late nineties after being the super star for nearly 20 years.<br />
            He formed a popular screen couple with Rekha. He also has sung in movies like Laawaris, Toofan and Silsila. He became a grandfather in 1997 when his daughter Shweta gave birth to a daughter.<br />
            Actress Nirupa Roy has played his mother in several films.<br />
            Singer Sudesh Bhonsle has dubbed his voice for playback songs in many movies.<br />
            At the age of 58, Bachchan jumped from a height of 30 feet, along with co-star Manoj Bajpai, for his 2001 movie Aks (2001).<br />
            His heroes include Marlon Brando, Al Paccinno and Robert De Niro.<br />
