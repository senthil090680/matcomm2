            Jats take pride as an equalitarian society where everyone enjoys an equal status irrespective of their financial position. Their customs resemble Vedic Aryans as boys and girls belonging to the same gotra never get married. Though Jats are keen to marry within the community, they never look for prospective bride or groom within the same village. Widow remarraige is encouraged in the Jat community. Elders are given due respect and their opinion is sought before proceeding with any proposal. The Jats revel in joint family system, though it is less prevalent today.<br /><br />
            <b>Pre-wedding rituals</b><br />
            The Jats conduct marriages in accordance with Vedic rituals. These rituals have evolved since traditional times. As the Jats attach a lot of importance to weddings, the ceremonies are very colourful and extend for several days.<br /><br />
            <b>Sagai:</b> This ritual refers to the engagement ceremony and the period between engagement and actual marriage. Earlier, elders made decisions regarding the marriage and the selection criterion for the prospective bride or groom was their health status, family reputation, and the property they held by their family. However, this tradition is changing gradually. <br /><br />
            <b>Aguthi</b> Pahanana: During engagement, the groom visits the bride's home along with family members and relatives and presents the bride with an engagement ring. The bride wears the ring on her left ring finger, indicating the formal agreement for marriage. <br /><br />
