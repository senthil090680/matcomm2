			<b>Marriage Rituals</b><br />
            Traditionally, the wedding was conducted at the groom's residence. Today, the venue has shifted to wedding halls. Nevertheless, the marriage is celebrated with gaiety and fervor.<br /><br />
            <b>The Ceremonial Procession</b><br />
            The marriage begins with the bridegroom's party visiting the bride's house in a ceremonial procession, carrying turmeric, coconuts, plantains, betel leaves, flowers, dry fruits and a saree for the bride including the thali and a thread dyed yellow with turmeric.<br /><br />
            <b>Muhurtham</b><br />
            The Muhurtham refers to the auspicious timing of the actual wedding ceremony itself. This is based on astrology. Usually, the auspicious time is set early in the morning (5 am till around 7-8 am). The wedding ceremony will be held under the marriage canopy, which consists of a temporary thatched structure made of coconut leaves knit together.<br /><br />
            <b>Thalikettu</b><br />
            The thalikettu is the highlight of the marriage. The bride is bedecked in fine jewelry and an ornate sari and made to sit to the right of the groom. The thali is taken around in a plate and blessings of elders and relatives are sought. After this, the groom ties the thali around the bride's neck assisted by his sister. Three knots are made and as this happens, conch shells are blown and nadaswaram is played in a high pitch. Once the thali is tied the bride sits at the groom's left. Both of them face east. Coconuts are broken and prayers are offered to the gods.<br /><br />
            <b>Kulavaiyidal</b><br />
            This is a special custom followed by the Thevars. Women present at the wedding raise a shrill chant called kulavai. After this, flowers and coloured rice are thrown on the heads of the couple.<br /><br />
            <b>Maalai Matral</b><br />
            Maalai Matral refers to the act of the couple exchanging garlands. The groom takes the right hand of the bride and goes around the sacred fire thrice. Once this is completed, the couple prostrate before their parents and elders to seek blessings. <br /><br />
