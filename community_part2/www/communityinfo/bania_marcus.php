			The marriage ceremony in a Bania family starts with the worship of Lord Ganpati in both the houses of the bride and the groom. It is called 'Mandav'. Then the ladies of the house go to a potter's place, signing and dancing, as a procession, there they sprinkle sandalwood powder and flowers on the potter's wheel, after which they bring earthen pots back home to be, used in the marriage ceremonies.<br /><br />
            A day before the marriage both the Bania families exchange gifts and wedding dress for bride and groom. However both the bride and the groom do not participate in these rituals. <br /><br />
            To begin with the marriage day ceremonies, balls of cow dung ashes are thrown in all the four directions, meanwhile the bride's mother takes seven circular rounds around the groom holding curd in two earthen pots, which afterwards are crushed by the right foot of the groom allowing him to enter the Bride's house or the place of marriage.<br /><br />
            Then the mother of the Bania bride washes the feet of the groom with honey, curd, sugar, milk and ghee to add the purifying factor. After this, the actual marriage ceremonies take place of Kanyadan (a ritual where the parents gives away the responsibility of their daughter to the groom for the lifetime), phere (seven circles around the sacred fire to promise each others support in all walks of life), after which the groom applies sindur or read powder on the forehead of the groom and then makes her wear a 'mangalsutra', marking the proof of a married women. All this leads to the completion of the Bania marriage ceremonies, which are more or less like a Hindu marriage.<br /><br />
            Then the 'Bidayi, ceremony takes place, a part of which the Bania bride moves away to the groom's house to lead a happy married life. The carriage or the car carrying the bride towards her new house is made to crush a coconut to mark a pure and happy beginning of their married life.<br /><br />
