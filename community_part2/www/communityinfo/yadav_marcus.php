			Yadav or Yadava is an Indian caste that claims descent from Yadu. Yadavas have been mentioned as one of the panchjanya tribes in ancient Vedic texts. They are known for their bravery and diplomatic wisdom. Yadavs generally follow Vaishnav traditions and share Dharmic religious beliefs.<br /><br />
            Yadavs constitute more than 11 per cent of the Indian population. They are found in different parts of India and known as 'Goalas' and 'Sadgopa' or Gauda in Bengal and Orissa.<br /><br />
            The Yadava of Kannur district in Kerala is a caste group engaged in cattle-rearing traditionally. They are believed to have migrated from Andhra Pradesh before Independence. The Yadavas came and settled in certain towns, suburbs and townships in the erstwhile Malabar, i.e., in the Northern Kerala. Yadavas are concentrated in Kannur town, Koothuparamba, Thazhe Chovva, and in Calicut town. Most of the families are rearing buffaloes and selling milk. Continuous cultural contacts and various other factors like education, industries, and employment opportunities within the towns and outside paved the way for socio-cultural change. <br /><br />
            The Yadavas of Kerala are also called as Erumakar. In Malayalam, Eruma means buffalo and Erumakar means the people who rear buffalos. Cross cousin marriages are preferred among the Yadavas. Among the Yadavas, there are two clans or gotra, namely, vamma gotra and vankara gotra. The gotras are exogamous with clear exchange or marriage alliance patterns prohibiting certain gotra from marriage relation by others. The people belonging to vamma gotra marry only from the vankara gotra and vice versa restricting the alliance to certain gotras only. Apart from the traditional practices, some exceptional cases of marriages like inter-caste and love marriages could also be noticed.<br /><br />
            The supreme deity of the Yadavas is Kanchi and also has an important position in their society. These families have greatly reinforced their ritual, customs, marriages, etc., with pomp, splendor and luxury.<br /><br />
